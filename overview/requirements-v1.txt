PROJECT REQUIREMENTS - VERSION 1 (MVP)
=========================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
Simple Solana DEX with AMM functionality, focused on creating liquidity pools (LPs) with minimal fees, supporting SPL tokens, and enabling basic swap operations with Jupiter aggregator integration.

Timeline: 4-6 days
Budget: $180 (R$1000)


CORE REQUIREMENTS
-----------------

1. BLOCKCHAIN & SMART CONTRACTS
   - Platform: Solana blockchain
   - Framework: Anchor/Rust
   - Token Standard: SPL tokens (base and quote tokens)
   - Architecture: On-chain programs (smart contracts)
   - Cost Optimization: Minimize LP creation costs (deployment, accounts, storage)

2. LIQUIDITY POOL FUNCTIONALITY
   - Create multiple concentrated LPs between base token and different quote tokens
   - Support for Solana network tokens
   - Minimize on-chain fees (estimated 0.02 to 0.05 SOL per pool creation)
   - Account structure optimized for low storage costs

3. AMM IMPLEMENTATION (Simple Model)
   - Basic AMM with essential functions:
     * Add liquidity to pools
     * Remove liquidity from pools
     * Token swap functionality
   - Price calculation logic
   - Slippage control
   - Basic security measures for swap calculations

4. JUPITER AGGREGATOR INTEGRATION
   - Prepare structure to work with Jupiter routes
   - Enable swaps to be routed through Jupiter
   - Ensure instruction format compatibility with Jupiter
   - Note: Full direct integration deferred; basic route preparation for MVP

5. WEB INTERFACE (Frontend)
   - Technology: React
   - Lightweight and functional design
   - Features:
     * Connect Solana wallets: Phantom AND Solflare
     * List available token pairs/pools
     * Create new liquidity pools
     * Add liquidity to existing pools
     * Remove liquidity from pools
     * Perform token swaps
     * Display pool information and balances

6. WALLET INTEGRATION
   - Phantom wallet support
   - Solflare wallet support
   - Use standard Solana wallet adapters

7. FEE OPTIMIZATION
   - Minimize on-chain transaction fees
   - Optimize account creation and storage
   - Reasonable costs for end users
   - Automatic reinvestment of fees (to be clarified with client)

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------

1. COST STRUCTURE
   - On-chain fees: 0.02-0.05 SOL for account creation
   - Domain: ~R$40-80/year (~$10-15/year for .com)
   - Hosting: FREE (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for static frontend)
   - Client responsible for: domain registration and hosting setup (HostGator mentioned)

2. SECURITY PRIORITIES
   - Secure price calculation in AMM
   - Slippage protection
   - Basic validation for pool operations
   - Safe handling of user funds

3. OPTIMIZATION PRIORITIES
   - Lean account structure
   - Minimal storage requirements
   - Low transaction costs
   - Efficient instruction formatting for Jupiter compatibility

4. SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS
   - Support for multiple token pairs
   - Efficient pool lookup
   - Preparation for future Jupiter full integration


CONSTRAINTS & SIMPLIFICATIONS FOR MVP
--------------------------------------

1. Simple AMM model (not concentrated liquidity like Uniswap V3)
2. Basic Jupiter route preparation (full integration deferred)
3. Minimal UI design (functional over aesthetic)
4. Limited to SPL tokens on Solana
5. Basic testing coverage only
6. Using templates/open-source code acceptable to accelerate development
