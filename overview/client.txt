I own 12% of the tokens from memecoins EBOOKITO (EBK).

FENfZkkFXGBVYKNL5Z75guxaVhPJDjJGXPHW8bJWpump

It was created on pump.fun

Nome: Ebookito

Symbol: EBK

Decimal places: 9

It would be good to create an SPL token for EBK to work directly on the DEX.

The name of the Dex could be dexspeed.com.br or speeddex.com.br.

Can you create a logo? Like the ebookito logo?

If I were to create the logo, I would like to use the colors black, gold, silver, and shades of green; that would be great for the Dex and the logo.

See if you can use HostGator for hosting; they have a plan for R$50.00 per month.

We can test it first in the Deploy on Solana devnet (free testing environment).

I need to make some adjustments to the ebookito.com.br marketplace; in the future, I plan to use ebk tokens to be accepted as currency for purchasing products on the ebookito marketplace.

I also have another project underway, the marketplace www.speedmall.com.br , but both are being updated, and I'm trying to get them up and running.
