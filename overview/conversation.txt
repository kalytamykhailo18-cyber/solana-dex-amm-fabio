I need something simple, basically to create PLs (Points of Sale) with automatic reinvestment of fees, initially focused on tokens from the Solana network. With my limited resources, using a template would be sufficient. I want to create something that enables the creation of PLs with the lowest possible fees to help liquidity providers.
Is it possible to create a DEX for less than R$1000.00?

me:
I can be completely honest with you: a DEX with AMM, LP creation, automatic fee reinvestment, and an interface generally costs over $1,500, even using templates. This is because the on-chain part of Anchor requires considerable care, testing, and optimization to avoid high fees and security issues.
If you really only need something simple to start, I can work within the $180 budget. But if the intention is to have a more complete and robust DEX, with advanced integrations like Jupiter, we will need to consider a larger budget to ensure quality and security.

he:
What I need is something to start with; just being able to create concentrated PLs with Solana network tokens will already help a lot, it's the first step. However, the possibility of using Jupiter aggregator routes is also very important.
How many days would it take to complete this simple project, already installed and working?

me:
If the initial goal is simply to create concentrated LPs for Solana network tokens, with a simple AMM and already preparing the use of Jupiter routes, this MVP can be set up without complication. Full direct integration with Jupiter takes more time, but I can structure everything to work with the basic routes.
For this simple version, fully installed and working, I need 4 to 6 days.
This includes: basic contract in Anchor, creation of the LPs, simple AMM, lightweight front-end connecting Phantom, and configuration to use Jupiter routes.
If this timeframe is acceptable, I can start immediately.

he:
Can I also add a Solflare wallet to my wallet?

me:
Yes, I can add support for the Solflare wallet. The interface will allow connection of both Phantom and Solflare, using the standard adapters of the Solana ecosystem.
As soon as you send me the offer, I will begin development.
I will deliver the MVP with the creation of focused LPs, simple AMM, support for Phantom and Solflare, and preparation to operate with Jupiter routes.

he:
Do you know what the fees will be for the DEX installation? Domain and hosting?

me:
The fees for installing the DEX on Solana are very low.
The only real cost on the blockchain is the creation of on-chain accounts (pools, configurations, etc.). This usually ranges from 0.02 to 0.05 SOL, depending on the number of accounts needed, so it's quite cheap.
Regarding domain and hosting:
– Domain: depends on your choice, generally from R$40 to R$80 per year (a .com domain costs on average 10 to 15 dollars).
– Hosting: since the frontend is static, hosting on Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or Vercel is practically free. That is, zero cost for the web part.
The only mandatory expense is the small on-chain fee from Solana, which is very affordable.

he:
Okay, I'll check with HostGenerator to arrange hosting and also find a good domain name to register.

I'm looking at HostGator to sign up for a hosting plan and purchase a domain. Wouldn't it be better if I sent you the prices and you could handle the sign-up and domain purchase directly? Once everything is set up correctly, you can transfer the funds to me.
This would make it easier to access and install DeX.
You could do everything without needing my presence.

me:
Don't try to buy the domain now.
I'll test it on my test network first.

he:
Perfect, I have the funds set aside for the domain purchase and the hosting payment.
If you have any questions, you can send me a message on WhatsApp +55 (21) 99835-6976
But if possible, please send the messages in Portuguese.

Good afternoon, I would like to know how much it would cost to add a meme token creation module, similar to a mini pump.fun , leveraging the existing DEX structure. This would allow us to utilize several existing DEX features and add only a few additional functions.
