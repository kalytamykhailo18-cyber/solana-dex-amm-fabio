Description:
We are seeking an experienced Solana/DeFi developer to build a simple Decentralized Exchange (DEX), similar to Raydium, and an Automated Market Maker (AMM). The goal is to develop a functional MVP with the following essential requirements:

Key Requirements:

1. Solana Network: On-chain programs (smart contracts) must run on the Solana blockchain.
2. Use of SPL Tokens: The DEX must use SPL tokens for the base token and quote tokens.
3. Liquidity Pool (LP) Creation: Ability to create multiple pools between the base token and different quote tokens. An implementation that minimizes the cost of LP creation (deployment, accounts, storage) is preferred.
4. Simple AMM Model: Implementation of a basic AMM with essential functions such as adding/removing liquidity and exchanging tokens.
5. Integration with the Jupiter Aggregator: The DEX must be integrated with the Jupiter Aggregator, allowing swaps to be routed and leveraged via Jupiter.
6. Simple Web Interface: Development of a functional web interface for the MVP that allows:
    * Connecting to a Solana wallet (Phantom or similar).
    * Listing available token pairs.
    * Allowing adding and removing liquidity from pools.
    * Allowing token swaps.
7. Fee Optimization: The solution should be optimized so that fees and transactions on the Solana network are reasonable for users.

It is acceptable for the developer to use an existing DEX template or parts of open-source code to accelerate MVP development.

Desired Freelancer Profile:

* Proven experience in Solana network development, with proficiency in Anchor/Rust.
* History in DeFi projects, focusing on AMMs and Liquidity Pools.
* Experience with liquidity aggregator integration (knowledge of Jupiter will be a plus).
* Knowledge of front-end development (React, Vue, or similar technologies) to build a lightweight and efficient user interface.

Deliverables:

* On-chain DEX code (smart contracts/programs).
* Detailed technical documentation for deployment on testnet and mainnet.
* Integration and documentation for the Jupiter Aggregator.
* Minimal and functional front-end for interaction with the DEX.
* Basic tests covering swap and liquidity addition/removal functionalities.
